                <p > The Sewa Bhog is a zero-funds volunteer organization that works to get surplus food from restaurants and communities to serve the less fortunate.

                    Our workers are largely students and young working professionals â€“ everyone does this in their free time. The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve include homeless families, orphanages, patients from public hospitals and old age homes. </p>

                    <h3 class="anim">Vision</h3>
                    <p>Sewa Bhog intends to do exactly that. Help the helper. We try to close the information gap in the social impact space by providing socially-conscious organisations and people with relevant information at the right time.

                        Whether its an impact investor looking to fund social impact projects, a software engineer wanting to spend 4 hours a week for a social cause in the vicinity, an NGO looking for volunteers, or a large corporation looking for a partner to implement it's CSR programs on education, we want to connect all of them together and also provide them with analysed information to help make their decisions quickly and efficiently.</p>

                    <h3 class="anim">Motivation</h3>
                    <p> India has 3.3 million NGOs, tens of thousands of social enterprises and Section 8 companies, an unknown number of informal impact communities and tons of passionate hearts curious to help humanity. The last decade has seen an upsurge of social enterprises (a term that was not even common a decade ago), massive growth of social impact initatives and lots of learned individuals leaving the corporate world to work in this sector.

                        At this stage of growth, the sector needs a macro and micro level view of organisations and projects, to foster synergies, discover support and make informed decisions. Saathi Re intends to bring all organisations on the same platform for them to connect with each other and discover collaborations to catalyse impact, volunteers to find good work, impact investors and CSR heads to find relevant organisations and the Government to get a deeper view of the space in India.  </p>
